# How to install:
Vizality: Open a CMD/Powershell/Terminal/Gitbash window in the Plugin folder and use:
 `git clone https://github.com/bakzkndd/no-message-delete/`


# Note
This is NOT a message logger. All deleted messages are temporarily shown in the client until reload or close. Messages do not get logged in any place.
Messages deleted using bulk delete are NOT SHOWN. 
This plugin is only VISUAL and once again does NOT log.
