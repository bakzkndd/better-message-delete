# How to install:
Vizality: Open a CMD/Powershell/Terminal/Gitbash window in the Plugin folder and use:
 `git clone https://github.com/bakzkndd/better-message-delete/`


# Note
This is NOT a message logger. All deleted messages are replaced in the client until reload, close or 60 second wait. Messages do not get logged in any place.
Messages deleted using bulk delete are NOT SHOWN. 
This plugin is only VISUAL and once again does NOT log.
